A lower resource discord client I created so I can still keep up with stuff while on my arch machine.
I'll continue working on it in my free time.

To login:
- find your token in a discord client you are already logged into
- create a .env file with the following:
    USER_TOKEN=<your_token>
- it should log you in automatically after that.
